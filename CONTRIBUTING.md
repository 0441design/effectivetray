# Contributing to Effective Tray
- If you want to contribute, if your fix or suggestion is short and easy to understand, you can just make a PR. For anything more complicated, please make an issue first. 
- Any style is fine, any kind of suggestion is fine. PRs that touch more than one issue or idea are also fine as long as they come with an explanation. 
- Bear in mind my skill is limited and that will change what might get implemented. 
※ *Please do not change anything to typescript.*

## Branches to Target
- For small fixes, target the branch with the version the smallest increment up from the current release (generally N.N.X). Right now, that is <font color=blue>1.0.2</font>.
- For fixes in line with a major system release, target the next major release (generally N.X.N). Right now, that is <font color=blue>1.1.0</font>.
- Generally speaking, make your PR targets branches with current milestones.
※ *If the above information becomes inapplicable, perhaps because I forgot to update it, just target the main branch.*
